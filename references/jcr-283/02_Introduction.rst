JCR 2.0: 2 Introduction (Content Repository for Java Technology API v2.0)
=========================================================================

2 Introduction
==============

The JCR specification defines an abstract model and a Java API for data
storage and related services commonly used by content-oriented
applications. The target domain encompasses not only traditional content
management systems but, more broadly, any application that must handle
both unstructured digital assets and structured or semi-structured
information.

The repository model enables efficient access to both large binary
objects and finely-structured hierarchical data through a simple,
generic API and a robust and extensible object typing system.
Additionally, many features that are traditionally custom-built on top
of RDBMSs and file systems have been incorporated into the repository
itself. These include support for query, access control, versioning,
locking and observation. Standardized support for these services further
enables applications that might not normally have access to such
advanced features to take advantage of them, since they are built-in at
the infrastructure level.
